# flexbox-simulator

This web app is an interactive Flexbox layout simulator, allowing users to dynamically modify flex properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction` to visualize and understand how they impact layout. Built using React, this tool makes it easy to experiment with responsive designs and see the effects of Flexbox in real-time.
